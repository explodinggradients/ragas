clarity: Evaluate the precision and understandability of the information presented. High scores (3) are reserved for contexts that are both precise in their information and easy to understand. Low scores (1) are for contexts where the information is vague or hard to comprehend.
depth: Determine the level of detailed examination and the inclusion of innovative insights within the context. A high score indicates a comprehensive and insightful analysis, while a low score suggests a superficial treatment of the topic.
structure: Assess how well the content is organized and whether it flows logically. High scores are awarded to contexts that demonstrate coherent organization and logical progression, whereas low scores indicate a lack of structure or clarity in progression.
relevance: Judge the pertinence of the content to the main topic, awarding high scores to contexts tightly focused on the subject without unnecessary digressions, and low scores to those that are cluttered with irrelevant information.

Asses the given question for clarity and answerability given enough domain knowledge, consider the following criteria:
1.Independence: Can the question be understood and answered without needing additional context or access to external references not provided within the question itself? Questions should be self-contained, meaning they do not rely on specific documents, tables, or prior knowledge not shared within the question.
2.Clear Intent: Is it clear what type of answer or information the question seeks? The question should convey its purpose without ambiguity, allowing for a direct and relevant response.
Based on these criteria, assign a verdict of "1" if a question is specific, independent, and has a clear intent, making it understandable and answerable based on the details provided. Assign "0" if it fails to meet one or more of these criteria due to vagueness, reliance on external references, or ambiguity in intent.
Provide feedback and a verdict in JSON format, including suggestions for improvement if the question is deemed unclear. Highlight aspects of the question that contribute to its clarity or lack thereof, and offer advice on how it could be reframed or detailed for better understanding and answerability.
