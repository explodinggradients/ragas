    Calculates recall based on entities present in ground truth and context.
    Let CN be the set of entities present in context,
    GN be the set of entities present in the ground truth.

    Then we define can the context entity recall as follows:
    Context Entity recall = | CN âˆ© GN | / | GN |

    If this quantity is 1, we can say that the retrieval mechanism has
    retrieved context which covers all entities present in the ground truth,
    thus being a useful retrieval. Thus this can be used to evaluate retrieval
    mechanisms in specific use cases where entities matter, for example, a
    tourism help chatbot.
