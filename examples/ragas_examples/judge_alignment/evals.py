LLM-as-Judge alignment evaluation example.

Evaluates how well an LLM judge aligns with human judgments by:
- Using pre-existing responses from the dataset
- LLM judge evaluates each response
- Measuring alignment between judge and human labels

ABBREVIATION GUIDE - decode these correctly:
• Financial: val=valuation, post-$=post-money, rev=revenue, ARR/MRR=Annual/Monthly Recurring Revenue, COGS=Cost of Goods Sold, Opex=Operating Expenses, LTV=Lifetime Value, CAC=Customer Acquisition Cost
• Business: mkt=market, reg/regs=regulation/regulatory, corp gov=corporate governance, integr=integration, S&M=Sales & Marketing, R&D=Research & Development, acq=acquisition
• Technical: sys=system, elim=elimination, IP=Intellectual Property, TAM=Total Addressable Market, diff=differentiation
• Metrics: NPS=Net Promoter Score, SROI=Social Return on Investment, proj=projection, cert=certification

EVALUATION APPROACH:

Step 1 - Parse grading notes into distinct concepts:
- Separate by commas, semicolons, or line breaks
- Each item is a concept that must be verified
- Example: "*Gross Margin* >40%, CAC, LTV:CAC >3:1" = 3 concepts

Step 2 - For each concept, check if it's addressed:
- Accept semantic equivalents (e.g., "customer acquisition cost" = "CAC")
- Accept implicit coverage when it's clear (e.g., "revenue forecasting" covers "historical vs forecasted rev")
- Be flexible on exact numbers (e.g., "around 40%" acceptable for ">40%")

Step 3 - Count missing concepts:
- Missing 0 concepts = PASS
- Missing 1+ concepts = FAIL (even one genuinely missing concept should fail)
- Exception: If a long list (10+ items) has 1 very minor detail missing but all major points covered, use judgment

CRITICAL RULES:

1. Do NOT require exact wording - "market demand" = "mkt demand" = "demand analysis"

2. Markers (* or !) mean important, not mandatory exact phrases:
   - "*traction evidence*" can be satisfied by discussing metrics, growth, or validation
   - "!unbiased assumptions" can be satisfied by discussing assumption methodology

3. Numbers should be mentioned but accept approximations:
   - "$47B to $10B" can be "$47 billion dropped to around $10 billion"
   - "LTV:CAC >3:1" can be "LTV to CAC ratio of at least 3 to 1" or "3x or higher"

4. FAIL only when concepts are genuinely absent:
   - If notes mention "liquidation prefs, anti-dilution, board seats" but response only has board seats → FAIL
   - If notes mention "scalability, tech debt, IP" but response never discusses technical risks → FAIL
   - If notes mention "GDPR compliance" and response never mentions GDPR or EU regulations → FAIL

5. PASS when ALL concepts present:
   - All concepts covered, even with different wording → PASS
   - Concepts addressed implicitly when clearly implied → PASS
   - Minor phrasing differences → PASS
   - One or more concepts genuinely absent → FAIL
