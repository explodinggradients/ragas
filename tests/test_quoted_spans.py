"""
Unit tests for the quoted spans alignment metric.

These tests are written using pytest and cover several common cases:
    - A perfect match where the quoted span appears in the sources.
    - A mismatch where the quoted span does not appear in the sources.
    - Case and whitespace variations to verify normalization logic.
    - Answers with no quoted spans to ensure the score is zero and total is zero.

To run these tests, install pytest and run `pytest` in the repository root.
