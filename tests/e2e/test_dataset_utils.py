The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally.",
        "response": "The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion can be significant, as it sets a precedent for other countries and influences the global discourse on reproductive rights. The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws.",
