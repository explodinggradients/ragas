# Evaluate a simple LLM application

The purpose of this guide is to illustrate a simple workflow for testing and evaluating an LLM application with `ragas`. It assumes minimum knowledge in AI application building and evaluation. Please refer to our [installation instruction](./install.md) for installing `ragas`

!!! tip "Get a Working Example"
    The fastest way to see these concepts in action is to create a project using the quickstart command:

    ```sh
    ragas quickstart rag_eval
    ```

    This generates a complete project with sample code. Follow along with this guide to understand what's happening in your generated code.

    ```sh
    cd rag_eval
    ```

    Let's get started

## Project Structure

Here's what gets created for you:

```sh
rag_eval/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Quick start guide for your project
â”œâ”€â”€ evals.py              # Your evaluation code (metrics + datasets)
â”œâ”€â”€ rag.py                # Your RAG/LLM application
â””â”€â”€ evals/                # Evaluation artifacts
    â”œâ”€â”€ datasets/         # Test data files (edit these to add more test cases)
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiments/      # Results from running evaluations
    â””â”€â”€ logs/             # Evaluation execution logs
```

**Key files to focus on:**

- **`evals.py`** - Where you define metrics and load test data (we'll explore this next)
- **`rag.py`** - Your application code (query engine, retrieval, etc.)
- **`evals/datasets/`** - Add your test cases here as CSV or JSON files

## Understanding the Code

In your generated project's `evals.py` file, you'll see two key patterns for evaluation:

1. **Metrics** - Functions that score your application's output
2. **Datasets** - Test data that your application is evaluated against

`ragas` offers a variety of evaluation methods, referred to as [metrics](../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/index.md). Let's walk through the most common ones you'll encounter.

### Custom Evaluation with LLMs

In your generated project, you'll see the `DiscreteMetric` - a flexible metric that uses an LLM to evaluate based on any criteria you define:

```python
from ragas.metrics import DiscreteMetric
from ragas.llms import llm_factory

# Create your evaluator LLM
evaluator_llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o")

# Define a custom metric
my_metric = DiscreteMetric(
    name="correctness",
    prompt="Check if the response is correct. Return 'pass' or 'fail'.\nResponse: {response}\nExpected: {expected}",
    allowed_values=["pass", "fail"],
)

# Use it to score
score = my_metric.score(
    llm=evaluator_llm,
    response="The capital of France is Paris",
    expected="Paris"
)
print(f"Score: {score.value}")  # Output: 'pass'
```

What you see in your generated `evals.py` lets you define evaluation logic that matters for your application. Learn more about [custom metrics](../concepts/metrics/index.md).

### Choosing Your Evaluator LLM

Your evaluation metrics need an LLM to score your application. Ragas works with **any LLM provider** through the `llm_factory`. Your quickstart project uses OpenAI by default, but you can easily swap to any provider by updating the LLM creation in your `evals.py`:

=== "OpenAI"
    Set your OpenAI API key:

    ```sh
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
    ```

    In your `evals.py`:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o")
    ```

    The quickstart project already sets this up for you!

=== "Anthropic Claude"
    Set your Anthropic API key:

    ```sh
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
    ```

    In your `evals.py`:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", provider="anthropic")
    ```

=== "Google Cloud"
    Set up your Google credentials:

    ```sh
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
    ```

    In your `evals.py`:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory("gemini-1.5-pro", provider="google")
    ```

=== "Local Models (Ollama)"
    Install and run Ollama locally, then in your `evals.py`:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory(
        "mistral",
        provider="ollama",
        base_url="http://localhost:11434"  # Default Ollama URL
    )
    ```

=== "Custom / Other Providers"
    For any LLM with OpenAI-compatible API:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory(
        "model-name",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        base_url="https://your-api-endpoint"
    )
    ```

    For more details, learn about [LLM integrations](../concepts/metrics/index.md).

### Using Pre-Built Metrics

`ragas` comes with pre-built metrics for common evaluation tasks. For example, [AspectCritic](../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/aspect_critic.md) evaluates any aspect of your output:

```python
from ragas.metrics.collections import AspectCritic
from ragas.llms import llm_factory

# Setup your evaluator LLM
evaluator_llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o")

# Use a pre-built metric
metric = AspectCritic(
    name="summary_accuracy",
    definition="Verify if the summary is accurate and captures key information.",
    llm=evaluator_llm
)

# Score your application's output
score = await metric.ascore(
    user_input="Summarize this text: ...",
    response="The summary of the text is..."
)
print(f"Score: {score.value}")  # 1 = pass, 0 = fail
print(f"Reason: {score.reason}")
```

Pre-built metrics like this save you from defining evaluation logic from scratch. Explore [all available metrics](../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/index.md).

!!! info
    There are many other types of metrics that are available in `ragas` (with and without `reference`), and you may also create your own metrics if none of those fits your case. To explore this more checkout [more on metrics](../concepts/metrics/index.md).

### Evaluating on a Dataset

In your quickstart project, you'll see in the `load_dataset()` function, which creates test data with multiple samples:

```python
from ragas import Dataset

# Create a dataset with multiple test samples
dataset = Dataset(
    name="test_dataset",
    backend="local/csv",  # Can also use JSONL, Google Drive, or in-memory
    root_dir=".",
)

# Add samples to the dataset
data_samples = [
    {
        "user_input": "What is ragas?",
        "response": "Ragas is an evaluation framework...",
        "expected": "Ragas provides objective metrics..."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "How do metrics work?",
        "response": "Metrics score your application...",
        "expected": "Metrics evaluate performance..."
    },
]

for sample in data_samples:
    dataset.append(sample)

# Save to disk
dataset.save()
```

This gives you multiple test cases instead of evaluating one example at a time. Learn more about [datasets and experiments](../concepts/components/eval_dataset.md).

Your generated project includes sample data in the `evals/datasets/` folder - you can edit those files to add more test cases.
