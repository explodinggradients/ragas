# Evaluate a simple LLM application

The purpose of this guide is to illustrate a simple workflow for testing and evaluating an LLM application with `ragas`. It assumes minimum knowledge in AI application building and evaluation. Please refer to our [installation instruction](./install.md) for installing `ragas`

!!! tip "Get a Working Example"
    The fastest way to see these concepts in action is to create a project using the quickstart command:

    === "uvx (Recommended)"
        ```sh
        uvx ragas quickstart rag_eval
        cd rag_eval
        uv sync
        ```

    === "Install Ragas First"
        ```sh
        pip install ragas
        ragas quickstart rag_eval
        cd rag_eval
        uv sync
        ```

    This generates a complete project with sample code. Follow along with this guide to understand what's happening in your generated code. Let's get started!

## Project Structure

Here's what gets created for you:

```sh
rag_eval/
├── README.md             # Project documentation and setup instructions
├── pyproject.toml        # Project configuration for uv and pip
├── evals.py              # Your evaluation workflow
├── rag.py                # Your RAG/LLM application
├── __init__.py           # Makes this a Python package
└── evals/                # Evaluation artifacts
    ├── datasets/         # Test data files (optional)
    ├── experiments/      # Results from running evaluations (CSV files saved here)
    └── logs/             # Evaluation execution logs
```

**Key files to focus on:**

- **`evals.py`** - Your evaluation workflow with dataset loading and evaluation logic
- **`rag.py`** - Your RAG/LLM application code (query engine, retrieval, etc.)

## Understanding the Code

In your generated project's `evals.py` file, you'll see the main workflow pattern:

1. **Load Dataset** - Define your test cases with `SingleTurnSample`
2. **Query RAG System** - Get responses from your application
3. **Evaluate Responses** - Validate responses against ground truth
4. **Display Results** - Show evaluation summary in console
5. **Save Results** - Automatically saved to CSV in `evals/experiments/` directory

The template provides modular functions you can customize:

```python
from ragas.dataset_schema import SingleTurnSample
from ragas import EvaluationDataset

def load_dataset():
    """Load test dataset for evaluation."""
    data_samples = [
        SingleTurnSample(
            user_input="What is Ragas?",
            response="",  # Will be filled by querying RAG
            reference="Ragas is an evaluation framework for LLM applications",
            retrieved_contexts=[],
        ),
        # Add more test cases...
    ]
    return EvaluationDataset(samples=data_samples)
```

You can extend this with [metrics](../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/index.md) and more sophisticated evaluation logic. Learn more about [evaluation in Ragas](../concepts/evaluation/index.md).

### Choosing Your LLM Provider

Your quickstart project initializes the OpenAI LLM by default in the `_init_clients()` function. You can easily swap to any provider through the `llm_factory`:

=== "OpenAI"
    Set your OpenAI API key:

    ```sh
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
    ```

    In your `evals.py` `_init_clients()` function:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o")
    ```

    This is already set up in your quickstart project!

=== "Anthropic Claude"
    Set your Anthropic API key:

    ```sh
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
    ```

    In your `evals.py` `_init_clients()` function:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", provider="anthropic")
    ```

=== "Google Gemini"
    Set up your Google credentials:

    ```sh
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
    ```

    In your `evals.py` `_init_clients()` function:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory("gemini-1.5-pro", provider="google")
    ```

=== "Local Models (Ollama)"
    Install and run Ollama locally, then in your `evals.py` `_init_clients()` function:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory(
        "mistral",
        provider="ollama",
        base_url="http://localhost:11434"  # Default Ollama URL
    )
    ```

=== "Custom / Other Providers"
    For any LLM with OpenAI-compatible API:

    ```python
    from ragas.llms import llm_factory

    llm = llm_factory(
        "model-name",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        base_url="https://your-api-endpoint"
    )
    ```

    For more details, learn about [LLM integrations](../concepts/metrics/index.md).

### Using Pre-Built Metrics

`ragas` comes with pre-built metrics for common evaluation tasks. For example, [Aspect Critique](../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/aspect_critic.md) evaluates any aspect of your output using `DiscreteMetric`:

```python
from ragas.metrics import DiscreteMetric
from ragas.llms import llm_factory

# Setup your evaluator LLM
evaluator_llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o")

# Create a custom aspect evaluator
metric = DiscreteMetric(
    name="summary_accuracy",
    allowed_values=["accurate", "inaccurate"],
    prompt="""Evaluate if the summary is accurate and captures key information.

Response: {response}

Answer with only 'accurate' or 'inaccurate'.""",
    llm=evaluator_llm
)

# Score your application's output
score = await metric.ascore(
    response="The summary of the text is..."
)
print(f"Score: {score.value}")  # 'accurate' or 'inaccurate'
print(f"Reason: {score.reason}")
```

Pre-built metrics like this save you from defining evaluation logic from scratch. Explore [all available metrics](../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/index.md).

!!! info
    There are many other types of metrics that are available in `ragas` (with and without `reference`), and you may also create your own metrics if none of those fits your case. To explore this more checkout [more on metrics](../concepts/metrics/index.md).

### Evaluating on a Dataset

In your quickstart project, you'll see in the `load_dataset()` function, which creates test data with multiple samples:

```python
from ragas import Dataset

# Create a dataset with multiple test samples
dataset = Dataset(
    name="test_dataset",
    backend="local/csv",  # Can also use JSONL, Google Drive, or in-memory
    root_dir=".",
)

# Add samples to the dataset
data_samples = [
    {
        "user_input": "What is ragas?",
        "response": "Ragas is an evaluation framework...",
        "expected": "Ragas provides objective metrics..."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "How do metrics work?",
        "response": "Metrics score your application...",
        "expected": "Metrics evaluate performance..."
    },
]

for sample in data_samples:
    dataset.append(sample)

# Save to disk
dataset.save()
```

This gives you multiple test cases instead of evaluating one example at a time. Learn more about [datasets and experiments](../concepts/components/eval_dataset.md).

Your generated project includes sample data in the `evals/datasets/` folder - you can edit those files to add more test cases.
