    "[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. Makes it super easy to connect LLMs with your own data. But in order to figure out the best configuration for llamaIndex and your data you need a object measure of the performance. This is where ragas comes in. Ragas will help you evaluate your `QueryEngine` and gives you the confidence to tweak the configuration to get hightest score.\n",
