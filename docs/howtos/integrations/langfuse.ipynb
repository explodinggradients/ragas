    "3. [context precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html): Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally, all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "4. [aspect_critique](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/critique.html): This is designed to assess submissions based on predefined aspects such as harmlessness and correctness. Additionally, users have the flexibility to define their own aspects for evaluating submissions according to their specific criteria.\n",
