    "Ragas and Langfuse is a powerful combination that can help you evaluate and monitor your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Langfuse?\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) is an open-source platform for LLM [tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing), [prompt management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started), and [evaluation](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview). It allows you to score your traces and spans, providing insights into the performance of your RAG pipelines. Langfuse supports various integrations, including [OpenAI](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started), [Langchain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), and [more](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits of using Langfuse with Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Score Traces**: [Score](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview) your traces and spans, providing insights into the performance of your RAG pipelines.\n",
    "- **Detailed Analytics**: Segment and [analyze](https://langfuse.com/docs/analytics/overview) traces to identify low-quality scores and improve your system's performance.\n",
    "- **Score Reporting**: Drill down into detailed reports for specific use cases and user segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ragas ([GitHub](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)) is an open-source tool that can help you run [Model-Based Evaluation](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/model-based-evals) on your traces/spans, especially for RAG pipelines. Ragas can perform reference-free evaluations of various aspects of your RAG pipeline. Because it is reference-free you don't need ground-truths when running the evaluations and can run it on production traces that you've collected with Langfuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through and end-to-end example of RAG evaluations with Ragas and Langfuse.\n",

    "### The Metrics\n",
    "In this example, we will use the following metrics from the Ragas library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`faithfulness`](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/faithfulness.html): This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context.\n",
    "- [`answer_relevancy`](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/answer_relevance.html): Answer Relevancy, focuses on assessing how to-the-point and relevant the generated answer is to the given prompt.\n",
    "- [`context precision`](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html): Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally, all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "- [`aspect_critique`](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/critique.html): This is designed to assess submissions based on predefined aspects such as harmlessness and correctness. Additionally, users have the flexibility to define their own aspects for evaluating submissions according to their specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html) to learn more about these metrics and how they work."

      "answer:  The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion can be significant, as it sets a precedent for other countries and influences the global discourse on reproductive rights. Here are some potential implications:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Influence on other countries: The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws. It can provide legal arguments and reasoning that advocates for reproductive rights can use to challenge restrictive abortion laws in their respective jurisdictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Strengthening of global reproductive rights movements: A favorable ruling by the Supreme Court can energize and empower reproductive rights movements worldwide. It can serve as a rallying point for activists and organizations advocating for women's rights, leading to increased mobilization and advocacy efforts globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Counteracting anti-abortion movements: Conversely, a ruling that restricts abortion rights can embolden anti-abortion movements globally. It can provide legitimacy to their arguments and encourage similar restrictive measures in other countries, potentially leading to a rollback of existing reproductive rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Impact on international aid and policies: The Supreme Court's ruling can influence international aid and policies related to reproductive health. It can shape the priorities and funding decisions of donor countries and organizations, potentially leading to increased support for reproductive rights initiatives or conversely, restrictions on funding for abortion-related services.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Shaping international human rights standards: The ruling can contribute to the development of international human rights standards regarding reproductive rights. It can influence the interpretation and application of existing human rights treaties and conventions, potentially strengthening the recognition of reproductive rights as fundamental human rights globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Global health implications: The Supreme Court's ruling can have implications for global health outcomes, particularly in countries with restrictive abortion laws. It can impact the availability and accessibility of safe and legal abortion services, potentially leading to an increase in unsafe abortions and related health complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the specific implications will depend on the nature of the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent actions taken by governments, activists, and organizations both within and outside the United States.\n"
