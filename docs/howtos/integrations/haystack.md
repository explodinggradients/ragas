# Haystack Integration

Haystack is a  LLM orchestration framework to build customizable, production-ready LLM applications. 

The underlying concept of Haystack is that all individual tasks, such as storing documents, retrieving relevant data, and generating responses, are handled by modular components like Document Stores, Retrievers, and Generators, which are seamlessly connected and orchestrated using Pipelines.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will build a RAG pipeline using Haystack and evaluate it with Ragas. We’ll start by setting up the various components of the RAG pipeline, and for evaluations, we will initialize the RagasEvaluator component. Once the components are set up, we'll connect the components to form the complete pipeline. Later in the tutorial, we will explore how to perform evaluations using custom-defined metrics in Ragas.

## Installing Dependencies


```python
%pip install ragas-haystack
```

#### Getting the data

## Initialize components for RAG pipeline

#### Initializing the DocumentStore


```python
from haystack import Document
from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore

document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()
docs = [Document(content=doc) for doc in dataset]
```

#### Initalize the Document and Text Embedder


```python
from haystack.components.embedders import OpenAITextEmbedder, OpenAIDocumentEmbedder

document_embedder = OpenAIDocumentEmbedder(model="text-embedding-3-small")
text_embedder = OpenAITextEmbedder(model="text-embedding-3-small")
```

Now we have our document store and the document embedder, using them we will fill populate out vector datastore.


```python
docs_with_embeddings = document_embedder.run(docs)
document_store.write_documents(docs_with_embeddings["documents"])
```

#### Initialize the Retriever


```python
from haystack.components.retrievers.in_memory import InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever

retriever = InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever(document_store, top_k=2)
```

#### Define a Template Prompt


```python
from haystack.components.builders import ChatPromptBuilder
from haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage

template = [
    ChatMessage.from_user(
        """
Given the following information, answer the question.

Context:
{% for document in documents %}
    {{ document.content }}
{% endfor %}

Question: {{question}}
Answer:
"""
    )
]

prompt_builder = ChatPromptBuilder(template=template)
```

#### Initialize a ChatGenerator


```python
from haystack.components.generators.chat import OpenAIChatGenerator

chat_generator = OpenAIChatGenerator(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

#### Setting up the RagasEvaluator

Pass all the Ragas metrics you want to use for evaluation, ensuring that all the necessary information to calculate each selected metric is provided.

For example:

- **AnswerRelevancy**: requires both the **query** and the **response**.
- **ContextPrecision**: requires the **query**, **retrieved documents**, and the **reference**.
- **Faithfulness**: requires the **query**, **retrieved documents**, and the **response**.

Make sure to include all relevant data for each metric to ensure accurate evaluation.


```python
from haystack_integrations.components.evaluators.ragas import RagasEvaluator

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from ragas.llms import LangchainLLMWrapper
from ragas.metrics import AnswerRelevancy, ContextPrecision, Faithfulness

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
evaluator_llm = LangchainLLMWrapper(llm)

ragas_evaluator = RagasEvaluator(
    ragas_metrics=[AnswerRelevancy(), ContextPrecision(), Faithfulness()],
    evaluator_llm=evaluator_llm,
)
```

## Building and Assembling the Pipeline

#### Creating the Pipeline


```python
from haystack import Pipeline

rag_pipeline = Pipeline()
```

#### Adding the components


```python
from haystack.components.builders import AnswerBuilder

rag_pipeline.add_component("text_embedder", text_embedder)
rag_pipeline.add_component("retriever", retriever)
rag_pipeline.add_component("prompt_builder", prompt_builder)
rag_pipeline.add_component("llm", chat_generator)
rag_pipeline.add_component("answer_builder", AnswerBuilder())
rag_pipeline.add_component("ragas_evaluator", ragas_evaluator)
```
#### Connecting the components

```python
rag_pipeline.connect("text_embedder.embedding", "retriever.query_embedding")
rag_pipeline.connect("retriever", "prompt_builder")
rag_pipeline.connect("prompt_builder.prompt", "llm.messages")
rag_pipeline.connect("llm.replies", "answer_builder.replies")
rag_pipeline.connect("retriever", "answer_builder.documents")
rag_pipeline.connect("llm.replies", "answer_builder.replies")
rag_pipeline.connect("retriever", "answer_builder.documents")
rag_pipeline.connect("retriever", "ragas_evaluator.documents")
rag_pipeline.connect("llm.replies", "ragas_evaluator.response")
```





## Running the Pipeline


```python
question = "What makes Meta AI’s LLaMA models stand out?"

reference = "Meta AI’s LLaMA models stand out for being open-source, supporting innovation and experimentation due to their accessibility and strong performance."


result = rag_pipeline.run(
    {
        "text_embedder": {"text": question},
        "prompt_builder": {"question": question},
        "answer_builder": {"query": question},
        "ragas_evaluator": {"query": question, "reference": reference},
        # Each metric expects a specific set of parameters as input. Refer to the
        # Ragas class' documentation for more details.
    }
)

print(result['answer_builder']['answers'][0].data, '\n')
print(result['ragas_evaluator']['result'])
```
Output
```
Evaluating: 100%|██████████| 3/3 [00:14<00:00,  4.72s/it]

```

## Advance Usage

Instead of using the default ragas metrics, you can change them to fit your needs or even create your own custom metrics. After that, you can pass these to the RagasEvaluator component. To learn more about how to customize ragas metrics, check out the [docs](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/howtos/customizations/).

In the example below, we will define two custom Ragas metrics:

1. **SportsRelevanceMetric**: This metric evaluates whether a question and its response are related to sports.
2. **AnswerQualityMetric**: This metric measures how well the response provided by the LLM answers the user's question.


```python
from ragas.metrics import RubricsScore, AspectCritic

SportsRelevanceMetric = AspectCritic(
    name="sports_relevance_metric",
    definition="Were the question and response related to sports?",
    llm=evaluator_llm,
)

rubrics = {
    "score1_description": "The response does not answer the user input.",
    "score2_description": "The response partially answers the user input.",
    "score3_description": "The response fully answer the user input"
}

evaluator = RagasEvaluator(
    ragas_metrics=[SportsRelevanceMetric, RubricsScore(llm=evaluator_llm, rubrics=rubrics)],
    evaluator_llm=evaluator_llm
)

output = evaluator.run(
    query="Which is the most popular global sport?",
    documents=[
        "Football is undoubtedly the world's most popular sport with"
        " major events like the FIFA World Cup and sports personalities"
        " like Ronaldo and Messi, drawing a followership of more than 4"
        " billion people."
    ],
    response="Football is the most popular sport with around 4 billion"
                " followers worldwide",
)

output['result']
```
Output
```
Evaluating: 100%|██████████| 2/2 [00:01<00:00,  1.62it/s]

{'sports_relevance_metric': 1.0000, 'domain_specific_rubrics': 3.0000}
```
