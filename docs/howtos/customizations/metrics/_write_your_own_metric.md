While Ragas has [a number of built-in metrics](./../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/index.md), you may find yourself needing to create a custom metric for your use case. This guide will help you do just that.

For the sake of this tutorial, let's assume we want to build a custom metric that measures the hallucinations in a LLM application. While we do have a built-in metric called [Faithfulness][ragas.metrics.Faithfulness] which is similar but not exactly the same. `Faithfulness` measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context while `Hallucinations` measures the presence of hallucinations in the generated answer.

before we start, let's load the dataset and define the LLM:


```python
# dataset
from datasets import load_dataset
from ragas import EvaluationDataset

amnesty_qa = load_dataset("explodinggradients/amnesty_qa", "english_v3")
eval_dataset = EvaluationDataset.from_hf_dataset(amnesty_qa["eval"])
```


```python
eval_dataset
```




    EvaluationDataset(features=['user_input', 'retrieved_contexts', 'response', 'reference'], len=20)



--8<--
choose_evaluator_llm.md
--8<--


```python
from ragas.llms import llm_factory

evaluator_llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o")
```

## Aspect Critic - Simple Criteria Scoring

[Aspect Critic](./../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/aspect_critic.md) that outputs a binary score for `definition` you provide. A simple pass/fail metric can bring clarity and focus to what you are trying to measure and is a better allocation of effort than building a more complex metric from scratch, especially when starting out.

Check out these resources to learn more about the effectiveness of having a simple pass/fail metric:

- [Hamel's Blog on Creating LLM-as-a-Judge that drives Business Result](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/llm-judge/#step-3-direct-the-domain-expert-to-make-passfail-judgments-with-critiques)
- [Eugene's Blog on AlignEval](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/aligneval/#labeling-mode-look-at-the-data)

Now let's create a simple pass/fail metric to measure the hallucinations in the dataset with Ragas.


```python
from ragas.metrics import AspectCritic

# you can init the metric with the evaluator llm
hallucinations_binary = AspectCritic(
    name="hallucinations_binary",
    definition="Did the model hallucinate or add any information that was not present in the retrieved context?",
    llm=evaluator_llm,
)

await hallucinations_binary.single_turn_ascore(eval_dataset[0])
```
Output
```
0
```


## Domain Specific Metrics or Rubric based Metrics

Here we will build a rubric based metric that evaluates the data on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the rubric we provide. You can read more about the rubric based metrics [here](./../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/rubrics_based.md)

For our example of building a hallucination metric, we will use the following rubric:


```python
rubric = {
    "score1_description": "There is no hallucination in the response. All the information in the response is present in the retrieved context.",
    "score2_description": "There are no factual statements that are not present in the retrieved context but the response is not fully accurate and lacks important details.",
    "score3_description": "There are many factual statements that are not present in the retrieved context.",
    "score4_description": "The response contains some factual errors and lacks important details.",
    "score5_description": "The model adds new information and statements that contradict the retrieved context.",
}
```

Now let's initialize the metric with the rubric and evaluator LLM and evaluate the dataset.


```python
from ragas.metrics import RubricsScore

hallucinations_rubric = RubricsScore(
    name="hallucinations_rubric", llm=evaluator_llm, rubrics=rubric
)

await hallucinations_rubric.single_turn_ascore(eval_dataset[0])
```
Output
```
3
```


## Custom Metrics

If your use case is not covered by those two, you can build a custom metric by subclassing the base `Metric` class in Ragas but before that you have to ask yourself the following questions:

1. Am I trying to build a single turn or multi turn metric? If yes, subclassing the `Metric` class along with either [SingleTurnMetric][ragas.metrics.base.SingleTurnMetric] or [MultiTurnMetric][ragas.metrics.base.MultiTurnMetric] depending on if you are evaluating single turn or multi turn interactions.

2. Do I need to use LLMs to evaluate my metric? If yes, instead of subclassing the [Metric][ragas.metrics.base.Metric] class, subclassing the [MetricWithLLM][ragas.metrics.base.MetricWithLLM] class.

3. Do I need to use embeddings to evaluate my metric? If yes, instead of subclassing the [Metric][ragas.metrics.base.Metric] class, subclassing the [MetricWithEmbeddings][ragas.metrics.base.MetricWithEmbeddings] class.

4. Do I need to use both LLM and Embeddings to evaluate my metric? If yes, subclass both the [MetricWithLLM][ragas.metrics.base.MetricWithLLM] and [MetricWithEmbeddings][ragas.metrics.base.MetricWithEmbeddings] classes.


For our example, we need to use LLMs to evaluate our metric so we will subclass the [MetricWithLLM][ragas.metrics.base.MetricWithLLM] class, and we are working for only single turn interactions for now so we will subclass the [SingleTurnMetric][ragas.metrics.base.SingleTurnMetric] class.

As for the implementation, we will use the [Faithfulness][ragas.metrics.Faithfulness] metric to evaluate our metric to measure the hallucinations with the formula

$$
\text{Hallucinations} = 1 - \text{Faithfulness}
$$


```python
# we are going to create a dataclass that subclasses `MetricWithLLM` and `SingleTurnMetric`
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

# import the base classes
from ragas.metrics.base import MetricWithLLM, SingleTurnMetric, MetricType
from ragas.metrics import Faithfulness

# import types
import typing as t
from ragas.callbacks import Callbacks
from ragas.dataset_schema import SingleTurnSample


@dataclass
class HallucinationsMetric(MetricWithLLM, SingleTurnMetric):
    # name of the metric
    name: str = "hallucinations_metric"
    # we need to define the required columns for the metric
    _required_columns: t.Dict[MetricType, t.Set[str]] = field(
        default_factory=lambda: {
            MetricType.SINGLE_TURN: {"user_input", "response", "retrieved_contexts"}
        }
    )

    def __post_init__(self):
        # init the faithfulness metric
        self.faithfulness_metric = Faithfulness(llm=self.llm)

    async def _single_turn_ascore(
        self, sample: SingleTurnSample, callbacks: Callbacks
    ) -> float:
        faithfulness_score = await self.faithfulness_metric.single_turn_ascore(
            sample, callbacks
        )
        return 1 - faithfulness_score
```


```python
hallucinations_metric = HallucinationsMetric(llm=evaluator_llm)

await hallucinations_metric.single_turn_ascore(eval_dataset[0])
```

Output
```
0.5
```


Now let's evaluate the entire dataset with the metrics we have created.


```python
from ragas import evaluate

results = evaluate(
    eval_dataset,
    metrics=[hallucinations_metric, hallucinations_rubric, hallucinations_binary],
)
```


```python

Output
```
{'hallucinations_metric': 0.5932, 'hallucinations_rubric': 3.1500, 'hallucinations_binary': 0.1000}
```



```python
results_df = results.to_pandas()
results_df.head()
```

Output
