## Persona's in Testset Generation

You can add different persona's to the testset generation process by defining the [Persona][ragas.testset.persona.Persona] class with the name and role description of the different persona's that might be relevant to your use case, and you want to generate testset for.

For example, for the [GitLab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) we might want to generate testset for different persona's like a new joinee, a manager, a senior manager, etc. And hence we will define them as follows:

1. New Joinee: Don't know much about the company and is looking for information on how to get started.
2. Manager: Wants to know about the different teams and how they collaborate with each other.
3. Senior Manager: Wants to know about the company vision and how it is executed.

Which we can define as follows:


```python
from ragas.testset.persona import Persona

persona_new_joinee = Persona(
    name="New Joinee",
    role_description="Don't know much about the company and is looking for information on how to get started.",
)
persona_manager = Persona(
    name="Manager",
    role_description="Wants to know about the different teams and how they collaborate with each other.",
)
persona_senior_manager = Persona(
    name="Senior Manager",
    role_description="Wants to know about the company vision and how it is executed.",
)

personas = [persona_new_joinee, persona_manager, persona_senior_manager]
personas
```




    [Persona(name='New Joinee', role_description="Don't know much about the company and is looking for information on how to get started."),
     Persona(name='Manager', role_description='Wants to know about the different teams and how they collaborate with each other.'),
     Persona(name='Senior Manager', role_description='Wants to know about the company vision and how it is executed.')]



And then you can use these personas in the testset generation process by passing them to the [TestsetGenerator][ragas.testset.generator.TestsetGenerator] class.


```python
from ragas.testset import TestsetGenerator
from ragas.testset.graph import KnowledgeGraph
from ragas.llms import llm_factory

# Load the knowledge graph
kg = KnowledgeGraph.load("../../../../experiments/gitlab_kg.json")
# Initialize the Generator LLM
llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o-mini")

# Initialize the Testset Generator
testset_generator = TestsetGenerator(knowledge_graph=kg, persona_list=personas, llm=llm)
# Generate the Testset
testset = testset_generator.generate(testset_size=10)
testset
```


```python
testset.to_pandas().head()
```

## Automatic Persona Generation

If you want to automatically generate persona's from a knowledge graph, you can use the [generate_personas_from_kg][ragas.testset.persona.generate_personas_from_kg] function.



```python
from ragas.testset.persona import generate_personas_from_kg
from ragas.testset.graph import KnowledgeGraph
from ragas.llms import llm_factory

kg = KnowledgeGraph.load("../../../../experiments/gitlab_kg.json")
llm = llm_factory("gpt-4o-mini")

personas = generate_personas_from_kg(kg=kg, llm=llm, num_personas=5)
```


```python
personas
```




    [Persona(name='Organizational Development Manager', role_description='Responsible for implementing job frameworks and career development strategies to enhance employee growth and clarify roles within the company.'),
     Persona(name='DevSecOps Product Manager', role_description='Responsible for overseeing the development and strategy of DevSecOps solutions, ensuring alignment with company goals and user needs.'),
     Persona(name='Product Pricing Analyst', role_description='Responsible for developing and analyzing pricing strategies that align with customer needs and market demands.'),
     Persona(name='Site Reliability Engineer', role_description='Responsible for maintaining service reliability and performance, focusing on implementing rate limits to prevent outages and enhance system stability.'),
     Persona(name='Security Operations Engineer', role_description="Works on enhancing security logging processes and ensuring compliance within GitLab's infrastructure.")]
