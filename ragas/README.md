Objective metrics, intelligent test generation, and data-driven insights for LLM apps

Ragas is your ultimate toolkit for evaluating and optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Say goodbye to time-consuming, subjective assessments and hello to data-driven, efficient evaluation workflows.
Don't have a test dataset ready? We also do production-aligned test set generation.

> [!NOTE]
> Need help setting up Evals for your AI application? We'd love to help! We are conducting Office Hours every week. You can sign up [here](https://cal.com/team/ragas/office-hours).

## Key Features

- üéØ Objective Metrics: Evaluate your LLM applications with precision using both LLM-based and traditional metrics.
- üß™ Test Data Generation: Automatically create comprehensive test datasets covering a wide range of scenarios.
- üîó Seamless Integrations: Works flawlessly with popular LLM frameworks like LangChain and major observability tools.
- üìä Build feedback loops: Leverage production data to continually improve your LLM applications.

## :shield: Installation

Pypi: 

```bash
pip install ragas
```

Alternatively, from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas
```

## :fire: Quickstart

### Evaluate your LLM App

This is 5 main lines:

```python
from ragas import SingleTurnSample
from ragas.metrics import AspectCritic

test_data = {
    "user_input": "summarise given text\nThe company reported an 8% rise in Q3 2024, driven by strong performance in the Asian market. Sales in this region have significantly contributed to the overall growth. Analysts attribute this success to strategic marketing and product localization. The positive trend in the Asian market is expected to continue into the next quarter.",
    "response": "The company experienced an 8% increase in Q3 2024, largely due to effective marketing strategies and product adaptation, with expectations of continued growth in the coming quarter.",
}
evaluator_llm = LangchainLLMWrapper(ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"))
metric = AspectCritic(name="summary_accuracy",llm=evaluator_llm, definition="Verify if the summary is accurate.")
await metric.single_turn_ascore(SingleTurnSample(**test_data))
```
