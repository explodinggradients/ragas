🚀 COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TEST FOR ALL MIGRATED METRICS

This script tests all three metrics that were migrated from LangChain to InstructorLLM:
1. Faithfulness (+ FaithfulnesswithHHEM)
2. AnswerCorrectness
3. FactualCorrectness

✅ Zero LangChain dependencies
✅ Direct OpenAI client usage via InstructorLLM
✅ No run_config needed
✅ Structured Pydantic output parsing
