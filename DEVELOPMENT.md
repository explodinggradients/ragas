# Development Guide for Ragas Monorepo

This comprehensive guide covers development workflows for the Ragas monorepo, designed for both human developers and AI agents.

## Quick Start (for Developers)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas.git

# 2. Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 3. Choose your installation type:

# RECOMMENDED: Minimal dev setup (79 packages - fast)  
make install-minimal

# FULL: Complete dev environment (383 packages - comprehensive)
make install

# 4. Verify everything works
make check

# 5. Start developing!
make help  # See all available commands
```

## Quick Start (for AI Agents)

AI agents working with this codebase should use these standardized commands:

```bash
# Essential commands for AI development
make help           # See all available targets
make install-minimal # Minimal dev setup (fast - 79 packages) 
make install        # Full environment (modern uv sync - 383 packages)
make check          # Quick health check (format + type)
make test           # Run all tests
make run-ci         # Full CI pipeline locally

# Individual development tasks
make format         # Format and lint all code
make type           # Type check all code
make clean          # Clean generated files
```

**Key Points for AI Agents:**
- Always use `make` commands rather than direct tool invocation
- Use `uv run` prefix for any direct Python tool usage
- Check `make help` for the complete command reference
- The CI pipeline uses the same commands as local development

## Monorepo Architecture

This repository is organized as a single project with integrated experimental features:

```sh
/                              # Main ragas project
├── src/ragas/                 # Main source code
│   └── experimental/          # Experimental features
├── tests/                     # Tests (unit, e2e, benchmarks)
│   └── experimental/          # Experimental tests
├── examples/                  # Example code
├── pyproject.toml             # Dependencies and configuration
├── docs/                      # Documentation
├── .github/workflows/         # CI/CD pipeline
├── Makefile                   # Build commands
└── CLAUDE.md                  # AI assistant instructions
```

### Project Components
- **Ragas Core**: The main evaluation toolkit for LLM applications (in `src/ragas/`)
- **Ragas Experimental**: Advanced features integrated at `src/ragas/experimental/`
- **Infrastructure**: Single CI/CD, documentation, and build system

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ 
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- Git

### Setup Process

#### Option 1: Using Make (Recommended)
```bash
# Recommended: Minimal dev setup (79 packages)  
make install-minimal

# Full: Complete environment (383 packages)
make install
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install uv if not available
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Minimal dev: Core + essential dev tools
uv pip install -e ".[dev-minimal]"

# Full dev: Everything (uses modern uv sync)
uv sync --group dev
```

#### Which Option to Choose?

**Use `make install-minimal` (79 packages) if you're:**
- Contributing to ragas development
- Need testing and linting tools
- Want fast CI/CD builds
- Working on code quality, docs, or basic features

**Use `make install` (383 packages) if you're:**
- Working on ML features requiring the full stack
- Need observability tools (Phoenix, MLflow)
- Developing with notebooks and advanced integrations
- Want the complete development environment

#### Installation Methods Explained

- **`install-minimal`**: Uses `uv pip install -e ".[dev-minimal]"` for selective minimal dev dependencies (79 packages)
- **`install`**: Uses `uv sync --group dev` for complete modern dependency management (383 packages)

### Verification
```bash
make check  # Runs format + type checking
make test   # Runs all tests
```

## Development Workflows

### Daily Development
```bash
# 1. Start your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Make changes to code

# 3. Check your work
make check           # Format and type check
make test            # Run tests

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### Before Submitting PR
```bash
make run-ci          # Run full CI pipeline
# Ensure all checks pass before creating PR
```

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Use the Makefile for all development
make help           # See available commands
make format         # Format all code (core + experimental)
make type           # Type check all code
make test           # Run all tests (core + experimental)
make check          # Quick format + type check
make run-ci         # Run full CI pipeline

# Or use direct commands for specific tasks
uv run pytest tests/unit          # Run core unit tests
uv run pytest tests/unit  # Run unit tests
uv run pyright src               # Type check source code
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Integration tests for complete workflows
3. **Benchmarks**: Performance tests for evaluation metrics

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific test categories
uv run pytest tests/unit
uv run pytest tests/e2e  
cd experimental && uv run pytest

# With coverage or specific options
uv run pytest tests/unit -k "test_name"
```

### Test Organization
- **Ragas Core**: `tests/` (unit, e2e, benchmarks)
- **Experimental**: `experimental/tests/` (unit, e2e)

## Code Quality & CI/CD

### Code Quality Pipeline
The `make format` command runs:
1. **isort**: Import sorting
2. **ruff format**: Code formatting
3. **ruff --fix-only**: Auto-fix issues (including unused imports)
4. **ruff check**: Final linting validation

### Type Checking
```bash
make type  # Type check all code with pyright
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Our GitHub Actions CI runs:
1. **Dependency Installation**: Using uv for consistent environments
2. **Code Quality Checks**: Format and type validation
3. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests across Python 3.9-3.12
4. **Multi-OS Testing**: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows

### Local CI Simulation
```bash
make run-ci  # Runs: format + type + test
```

## Project Guidelines

### Ragas Project
- **Language**: Python with type hints
- **Testing**: pytest with nbmake for notebook tests
- **Style**: Google-style docstrings
- **Architecture**: Modular metrics and evaluation framework with experimental features
- **Dependencies**: All defined in `pyproject.toml`

### Adding Dependencies
- **All features**: Add to `pyproject.toml`
- **Always**: Test with `make install` and `make test`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Reinstall in development mode
make install
```

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Run specific failing test
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_specific.py -v

# Check experimental test dependencies
uv run pytest tests/unit --collect-only
```

#### Formatting Issues
```bash
# Fix formatting
make format

# Check specific files
uv run ruff check path/to/file.py --fix
```

#### CI Failures
```bash
# Run the same checks locally
make run-ci

# Individual checks
make format  # Must pass
make type    # Must pass  
make test    # Must pass
```

### Development Environment Issues

#### uv Not Found
```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or use pip: pip install uv
```

#### Dependency Conflicts
```bash
# Clean install
make clean
make install
```

## AI Agent Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow for AI Agents
1. **Understand the task**: Read relevant documentation and code
2. **Plan the approach**: Identify which project(s) need changes
3. **Use standardized commands**: Always prefer `make` targets
4. **Test incrementally**: Use `make check` frequently during development
5. **Validate thoroughly**: Run `make run-ci` before completing

### Command Patterns for AI Agents
```bash
# Always start with understanding the current state
make help
ls -la  # Check current directory structure

# For code changes
make format  # After making changes
make test    # Verify functionality

# For project-specific work
make help                       # See available commands

# For investigation
uv run pytest --collect-only  # See available tests
uv run ruff check --no-fix    # Check issues without fixing
```

### File Modification Guidelines
- **Prefer editing** existing files over creating new ones
- **Use project conventions** (check similar files for patterns)
- **Update tests** when modifying functionality
- **Follow existing code style** (enforced by `make format`)

**Happy coding! 🚀**
