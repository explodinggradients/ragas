# Monorepo Project Structure

The repository is a monorepo consisting of two primary components:

1. [/](./) – Core evaluation toolkit
   • Source code lives in [src/](src/)
   • Tests live in [tests/](tests/)
   • Build configuration is in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

2. [examples/](examples/) – Root-level examples
   • Contains practical examples: agent_evals, prompt_evals, rag_eval, workflow_eval, benchmark_llm
   • Uses absolute imports and is designed for contributors
   • Install with: `uv pip install --system -e ".[examples]"`

Shared documentation for all projects is located under [docs/](docs/).

Root-level [Makefile](Makefile) provides combined commands, while each project directory also contains its own Makefile for project-specific tasks.
