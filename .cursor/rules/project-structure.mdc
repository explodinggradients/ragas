# Monorepo Project Structure

The repository is a monorepo consisting of two primary components:

1. [/](./) – Core evaluation toolkit
   • Source code lives in [src/](src/)
   • Tests live in [tests/](tests/)
   • Build configuration is in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

2. [examples/](examples/) – Installable examples package
   • Package: ragas_examples/ containing agent_evals, prompt_evals, rag_eval, workflow_eval, benchmark_llm
   • Build configuration in [examples/pyproject.toml](examples/pyproject.toml)
   • Shipped as `ragas-examples` package on PyPI via `ragas[examples]` extra
   • Local development: `uv pip install -e . -e ./examples`
   • Usage: `python -m ragas_examples.benchmark_llm.prompt`

Shared documentation for all projects is located under [docs/](docs/).

Root-level [Makefile](Makefile) provides combined commands, while each project directory also contains its own Makefile for project-specific tasks.
