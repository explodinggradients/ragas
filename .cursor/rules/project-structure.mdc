# Monorepo Project Structure

The repository is a monorepo consisting of two primary projects:

1. [ragas/](mdc:ragas/) – Core evaluation toolkit
   • Source code lives in [ragas/src/](mdc:ragas/src/)
   • Tests live in [ragas/tests/](mdc:ragas/tests/)
   • Build configuration is in [ragas/pyproject.toml](mdc:ragas/pyproject.toml)

2. [experimental/](mdc:experimental/) – nbdev-based experimental extensions
   • Generated code is in [experimental/ragas_experimental/](mdc:experimental/ragas_experimental/)
   • Generated code is in [experimental/ragas_experimental/](mdc:experimental/ragas_experimental/)
   • Build configuration is in [experimental/pyproject.toml](mdc:experimental/pyproject.toml)

Shared documentation for both projects is located under [docs/](mdc:docs/).

Root-level [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) provides combined commands, while each project directory also contains its own Makefile for project-specific tasks.
